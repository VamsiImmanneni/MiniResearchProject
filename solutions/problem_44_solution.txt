**Expected Output:**


```
[[-1, -2, -3], [-3, -2, -1]]

```



```
[[-1, -2, -3], [0, -2, 0]]
```

The provided function appears to not account for the input matrix being non-square and simply calculates the reflected values for all rows in the matrix. Therefore, the vectorized equivalent would also not account for the input matrix being non-square and simply calculate the reflected values for all rows in the matrix. 

```
import numpy as np

def reflect_matrix(vec):
    return [[-x if y%2 == 0 else x if y%2 == 1 else 0 for y
