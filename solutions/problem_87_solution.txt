`np.tril` can be used to obtain a lower triangular matrix from a given matrix. We can compare the matrix obtained from `np.tril` with the original matrix to check if it is lower triangular. If they are equal, then the original matrix is lower triangular.

```
import numpy as np

def is_lower_triangular(A):
    return np.array_equal(A, np.tril(A))

# Example
print(is_lower_triangular([[1, 0, 0], [1, 2, 0], [3, 4, 5]]))
# Output: True
```
